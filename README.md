# CMD Super Network – CMD


## Introduction to the CMD Open Platform
The CMD Open Platform is created by the CMD Foundation and the CMD Group. It will make the construction of decentralized applications more efficient and cost-effective, and provide comprehensive empowerment in aspects of promotion, traffic, and resources. In December 2020, the first product of the CMD Open Platform, the CMD Super Network, also known as CMD, officially launched its "Tinder" phase, it will launch core network. The CMD Open Platform will provide global developers with series of diverse innovative facilities and services.

## Introduction to CMD Super Network Chain
The CMD Super Network is a decentralized infrastructure network based on the underlying technology of innovation and future application development that is wholly invested by the CMD Foundation. It will make decentralized applications and ecosystems more efficient and energy-efficient during operation. CMD Super Network is compatible with Ethereum smart contracts and has more scalability. CMD Super Network reserves more space for the Layer 2 network and higher-level upgrades in the future, which will supplement and empower the Ethereum ecosystem. The token of CMD is produce by CMD Super Network, which uses the HPOS consensus mechanism.

## Vision
Technological innovation is the driving force behind the advancement of the blockchain industry, but many innovative projects have been misunderstood and ignored at their early stages. We have witnessed the growth process of great projects. Recalling that Ethereum and Polkadot were questioned as altcoins in the early days, they all went through difficult times. Therefore, CMD's mission is not only a public chain, but also to focus on the discovery and support of high-potential developers and innovative projects. Relying on the world's largest trading ecosystem, CMD is committed to becoming the birthplace of innovative technologies and innovative businesses, and building a complete ecological loop of technology development, application promotion, and trading.

## CMD’s Performance
- TPS: 1400+
- Average block interval: 3s

## Consensus Mechanism
HPoS consensus mechanism: it has the characteristics of low transaction cost, low transaction delay, and high transaction concurrency.

The maximum number of validators supported is 51.

## Economic Model 
The endogenous token on the chain is CMD; the transactions consume CMD as gas fee.

Miners pledge CMD to become validator nodes. The reward of nodes is gas fee and block reward, which is distributed according to the mortgage proportion. 

## Cross-Chain
Assets such as BTC, ETH and stable coins can be mapped to CMD by an asset bridge. The realization method is to lock a certain amount of tokens on the original chain then generate a corresponding number of tokens on CMD. 

CMD encourages developers to provide more decentralized cross-chain solution.  

## CMD Technical Characteristics
- An open and decentralized network to maintain the security of the network and assets.
- Support the programmability of EVM, the compatibility of smart contracts to reduce development or migration costs.
- Meta-transaction function: gas fee reduction, effectively reducing the cost of developers and users on the chain.
- Support cross-chain asset transfer to optimize users’ experience.


## Support Plan of CMD
### Financial Support
- COMMAND NETWORK FOUNDATION (SINGAPORE)
- CMD will set up a special fund to invest, support and incentivize high-potential developers.
- CMD will launch a variety of developer activities and competitions to discover and fund potential developers. 
- In order to reduce the cost of users on CMD Dapp, the CMD meta transaction function will reduce the gas fee of users holding HT in a step-wise manner.

### Traffic Support
CMD Group will strongly support the development of CMD ecosystem:
- Provide traffic entrance for high-quality Dapp on CMD.
- After running successfully on CMD, high-quality projects can submit token listing application to CMD Group, and can be listed on CMD Group if they meet the listing standards.

### Resource Support
- Projects or developers that have received investment and support from CMD have not only the opportunity to get official news report, but also can apply for marketing service packages and promote their projects globally.
- High-quality projects can participate in CMD global roadshows for free.
- CMD Group will open up ecological resources to high-potential developers, matching the win-win cooperation between developers and our ecological partners.
